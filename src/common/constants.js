                "This paper presents an active synchronous control scheme for distributed power grid connection based on the mobile network. This scheme avoids the disadvantages of the traditional control method, such as long waiting time and low reliability, and can meet the requirements of 'the hotplug online' distributed power grid connection. The scheme uses the mobile network to collect and detect voltage slip information between the distributed power system and large power grid before operation. When the voltage slip cannot meet the requirements of grid connection, the side voltage information of the distributed power system is actively regulated.",
